# Cloud-Computing

**Overview**  

This project focuses on advancing the field of image captioning, aiming to generate human-like textual descriptions for images using the ResNet model. The primary goal is to develop an innovative image analysis system capable of creating descriptive captions from the CIFAR-100 dataset. By leveraging cutting-edge deep learning methodologies, the system analyzes image content to extract meaningful insights and narrate the visual story effectively.  

**Features**  

**Deep Learning Integration:** Utilizes advanced deep learning techniques to understand and describe image content.  

**ResNet Model:** Implements the ResNet architecture for robust image feature extraction.  

**CIFAR-100 Dataset:** Employs the CIFAR-100 dataset, which contains 100 diverse classes of images, for training and evaluation. You can directly load the dataset. 

**AWS SageMaker:** Uses AWS SageMaker for seamless training and deployment of machine learning models.  

**Flickr Integration:** Incorporates Flickr for additional image captioning, enhancing the diversity and quality of generated descriptions.  

**Cloud Support:** Ensures smooth integration and deployment through cloud services, enhancing the project's scalability and accessibility.  

**Objectives**  

**Image Analysis:** Develop a system that can accurately analyze images and generate contextually relevant captions.  

**Model Training:** Utilize AWS SageMaker to facilitate the training and deployment of the ResNet model on the CIFAR-100 dataset.  

**Caption Generation:** Enhance the system's capability to generate diverse and informative captions by integrating Flickr data.  

**User Experience:** Improve user experiences across various visual domains through intelligent image analysis and seamless cloud integration.
This was implemented in AWS Sagemaker.
